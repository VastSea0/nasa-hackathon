  "summary": "Over the period of September 1st to October 2nd, 2025, the analyzed region is projected to experience generally mild weather with an average temperature of 20.61Â°C and moderate wind speeds of 2.48 m/s. Precipitation is expected to be very low, with a mean of 0.023 mm per day and no significant probability of exceeding 1 mm. The atmospheric conditions suggest a low risk of widespread environmental concerns, as indicated by a low mean drought index and moderate aerosol optical depth.",
  "risks": {
    "agri": [
      "Minimal precipitation could stress rain-fed crops, potentially impacting yields if dry spells are prolonged.",
      "Low humidity associated with dry conditions could increase the risk of pest outbreaks in susceptible crops."
    ],
    "health": [
      "Dry air could exacerbate respiratory issues for sensitive individuals.",
      "Low precipitation might lead to increased dust levels, affecting air quality."
    ],
    "transport": [
      "No significant weather-related transport disruptions are anticipated due to low precipitation and moderate winds.",
      "Increased dust from dry conditions could potentially reduce visibility on roads in affected areas."
    ]
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Farmers should implement water-efficient irrigation techniques and consider drought-resistant crop varieties to mitigate potential yield losses.",
    "Public health advisories should encourage hydration and measures to reduce dust exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations.",
    "Monitor soil moisture levels and dust particulate matter, and implement dust suppression measures if necessary, especially in agricultural and high-traffic areas."
